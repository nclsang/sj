            <h3 id="age0-9"><b>- Age of 0~9</b></h3>
            <p>Honestly, I don't remember clearly what I did at this age, but I'll try to keep my memory alive as much
                as
                possible.</p>
            <p>First of all, my hometown is Sokcho. Of course, Sokcho is famous for the East Sea. I remember going
                around
                with my family a lot when I was young.</p>
            <p>And, I traveled to <a href="https://namu.wiki/w/%EC%BA%84%EB%B3%B4%EB%94%94%EC%95%84"><b>Cambodia</b></a>
                with my mom, cousin sisters, aunt, and Maternal grandmother.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, It was before I went to the kindergarten, so I can't remember what I did and what I saw at
                that time.</p>
            <p>But I think it was a very good trip for me, because the memory of this trip remains a happy memory.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>I entered <a

                        Elementary School</a> when I was 8 years old.</b></p>
            <p>But, I went to this school only for the first semester and my family moved to Incheon in the second
                semester.
            </p>
            <p>The school I went was <a

            <p><b>The year of 6th grade's winter vacation,</b> I went abroad to Spain and France with my aunts, uncles,
                and
                cousin sisters.</p>
            <p>First, I went to Spain, and I went to <a

                        Nou</b></a> to watch soccer.</p>
            <p>It was a match between FC Barcelona and AT Madrid.</p>
            <p>At that time, there were so many famous players such as Messi, Neymar, Suarez, Griezmann, and Torres!!
            </p>
            <p>It was a really happy moment. The game was a 3-1 victory for Barcelona.</p>
            <p>Watching this game may be the top three happiest moments of my life.</p>
            <p>After graduating elementary school in Incheon, I moved back to Sokcho.</p><br>
            <p><b>At the age of 14,</b> I entered Sokcho Middle School.</p>
            <p>Until then, my dream was to be a soldier. That was because the drama <a
                    href="https://namu.wiki/w/%ED%83%9C%EC%96%91%EC%9D%98%20%ED%9B%84%EC%98%88"><b>'Descendants of the
                        Sun'</b></a> was popular at that time.</p>
            <p>I was attracted to the drama and dreamed of becoming a soldier and prepared to enter the <a
                    href="https://namu.wiki/w/%EC%9C%A1%EA%B5%B0%EC%82%AC%EA%B4%80%ED%95%99%EA%B5%90"><b>Korea military
                        academy.</b></a></p>
            <p>I thought I should work harder, so I even got second place in my school.</p>
            <p>However, that dream did not last long, and I finally decided to go to a regular high school.</p><br>
            <p><b>I entered <a
                        href="https://namu.wiki/w/%EC%86%8D%EC%B4%88%EA%B3%A0%EB%93%B1%ED%95%99%EA%B5%90"><b>Sokcho
                            High School</b></a> at the age of 17.</b></p>
            <p>Everyone knows that high school was the most important time.but,,, I was stupid.</p>
            <p>I worked hard until the first grade, but I gradually started to play games and neglected my studies.</p>
            <p>Now that I think about it, I really regret it. Why did I do that? ... </p>
            <p>So I failed my initial goal of In Seoul and it became the most regrettable moment in my life.</p>
            <br><br><br><br>
            <h3 id="age20-now"><b>- Age of 20~now</b></h3>
            <p><b>At the age of 20,</b> I entered <a
                    href="https://namu.wiki/w/%EA%B0%95%EC%9B%90%EB%8C%80%ED%95%99%EA%B5%90"><b>Kangwon
                        University.</b></a>
                And my department is computer engineering.</p>
            <p>I lived in a university dormitory, and this was my first time living alone in another region.</p>
            <p>At first, I was very lonely, but I became close to my roommate and got better soon.</p><br>
            <p><b>21 years old, on May 9, 2022,</b> I joined the army for 18 months.</p>
            <p>After a month of training at the Nonsan Training Center, I was placed in a place called <a
                    href="https://namu.wiki/w/%EC%A0%9C52%EB%B3%B4%EB%B3%91%EC%97%AC%EB%8B%A8"><b>the Communications
                        Company
                        of the 52nd Brigade of the 12th Division</b></a> in Wontong, Inje.</p>
            <p>There, I was a communications soldier (system installation soldier).</p>
            <p>I didn't want to spend any meaningless time in the military.So I learned my specialty and exercised
                harder
                than anyone else.</p>
            <p>As a result, I served as a squad commander and got a special fighter and advanced to the sergeant early.
            </p>
            <p>Surely it was a really meaningful moment.</p><br>
            <p><b>In June 2023,</b> I had a really hard training called KCTC.</p>
            <p>It was a mock war with other units, and it was the biggest training. I spent two weeks in a tent and in a
                car.</p>
            <p>During this training, I was able to solve the question of what I would do if a person was in an extreme
                situation. It was a training that I learned a lot.</p>
            <p><b>I went on vacation in August,</b> and went on a trip to Busan with my younger brother.</p>
            <p>When I heard Paris-Saint-German FC was invited to Korea, I decided that I had to watch the game between
                PSG
                and Jeonbuk in Busan.</p>
            <p>I was a big fan of Neymar, and Lee Kang-in had transfer to that team. So, for me, it was lucky.</p>
            <p><b>On November 8,</b> I was finally discharged from the military. It was the happiest moment in my whole
                life. For sure, can't forget that Happiness until I die.</p>
            <p>Three days later, I went to Waterpia for a part-time job. Now that I think about it, I think I lived
                really
                hard.</p><br>
            <p>I worked part-time job until <b>January 2024</b> in <a
                    href="https://namu.wiki/w/%EC%84%A4%EC%95%85%20%EC%9B%8C%ED%84%B0%ED%94%BC%EC%95%84?from=%EC%9B%8C%ED%84%B0%ED%94%BC%EC%95%84"><b>Waterpia</b></a>,
                and returned to university in March.</p>
            <p>Since then, I have been attending college and am satisfied with my own. I will definitely live harder in
                the
                future!!</p>
